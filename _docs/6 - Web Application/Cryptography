> **Identification of Encoding**

Using SEC642 as a base string:

* Base64 Encoding: U0VDNjQyIHI8Pjw+KyE= (always divisable by 4, 3 expanded to 4 characters)
* URL-Safe Base64 Encoding: U0VDNjQyIHI8Pjw-KyE= (+ is changed to -, / changed to _)
* URL Encoding: SEC642%20r%3C%3E%3C%3E%2B!
* Hex Encoding: 5345336343220723c3e3c3e2b21 (length isn't changed from ascii representation)
* MIME Encoding (Base64): =?UTF-8?B?U0VDNjQyIHI8Pjw+KyE=?=

> **Identification of Ciphers**

Using SEC642 as a base string:

* Block Ciper: Usually divisable 8
** DES and 3DES is 64 bits/8 bytes
** AES-128 and AES-256 is 128 bits/16 bytes
* ECB
** Look for repition to determine the number of bytes
* Stream Cipher: 1 bit to 1 bit

Note: Burp smart detect looks for 95% ascii characters so it wont work on crypto/hashing

> **Identification of Ciphers vs Hashing**

* Find the clear text and try to manipulate it with 8 characters.
* Then try 9 characters, and see how much it grew 
  * Grows by 8 cryptographic block cipher
  * Doesn't grow it is a hash
  * Grows by an equal amount than it is a stream cipher
* If crypto: then try a large number of characters and look for repition
  * Repitition my be ECB

Algorith | Type | Output Length
---------|------|---------------
RC4 | Stream Cipher | Matches input length (odd size)
DES/3DES | Block Cipher | 8 bytes per block
AES-128/192/246 | Block Cipher | 16 bytes per block
MD2/4/5 | Hash | 16 bytes
SHA/1 | Hash | 20 bytes
SHA2-224/512 SHA3-224 | Hash | 29 bytes
SHA2-256/512 SHA3-256 | Hash | 32 bytes
SHA2/3-384 | Hash | 48 bytes
SHA2/3-512 | Hash | 64 bytes
RIPEMD160 | Hash | 20 bytes

*If it is hashing and you know the plain text use SlavaSoft HASHCALC, OpenSSL,  or python passlib to compare.*
*Some software impliments their own hashing (vBulletin, MySQL 4.1, PHPass)*


> **Using ENT to perform entropy analysis**

Using ENT to perform entropy analysis with large datasets (not recommended for small data sets)

{% highlight bash %}
Entropy
#English words have entropies betweeen 4.5 and 5.5
#Higher than 5.5 is probably not clear text
#GZIP, random data, and other compressions can look encrypted

Chi Square
#Compressed data has 95-100% or 0-5% Chi square
#Encrpted data has 85-95% or 5-15% Chi square
#Random data has 15-85% chi square

ent english-words.txt 
Entropy = 5.05

ent english-words.txt.aes 
Entropy =7.99983 bits per byte
Chi Squeare = 

ent english-words.txt.gzip 
Entropy =7.999022 bits per byte
{% endhighlight %}

> **Location in code**

* Usually in the $where operator
* mapReduce
* DB.eval

> **NoSQL Queries vs SQL**

MySQL | MongoDB
<code> select * from users where ID = 1; </code> | <code> db.find.user({user_id: 1,}) </code>
<code> update set users password = '[input]' where id = 1; </code> | <code> db.update.user({user_id, [#]}, {$set {password: '[input]'}}) </code>

Errors:

Not Equals | <code> http://site.org/User[$ne]=1 </code>
